### Introduction

Minibase is a database management system which is designed not just to have a functional DBMS, but to have a DBMS where the individual components can be studied and implemented.
A relational database is a collection of data items organized as a set of formally-described tables from which data can be accessed or reassembled in many different ways without having to reorganize the database tables. 
A graph database is a database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges and properties to represent and store data. The key concept of the system is the graph (or edge or relationship), which directly relates data items in the store. The relationships allow data in the store to be linked together directly, and in many cases retrieved with one operation.

### Goal

Design and implement blocks of graph database management system on the top of relational database engine of minibase.

### System Requirement

Linux based machine
Make appropriate changes in make files based on Java version on your machine
